##FRR:
FRR is a high performance suite written primarily in C. It can easily handle full Internet routing tables and is suitable for use on hardware ranging from cheap SBCs to commercial grade routers. It is actively used in production by hundreds of companies, universities, research labs and governments.
##System Architecture
Traditional routing software is made as a one process program which provides all of the routing protocol functionalities. FRR takes a different approach. FRR is a suite of daemons that work together to build the routing table. Each major protocol is implemented in its own daemon, and these daemons talk to a middleman daemon (zebra), which is responsible for coordinating routing decisions and talking to the dataplane.

This architecture allows for high resiliency, since an error, crash or exploit in one protocol daemon will generally not affect the others. It is also flexible and extensible since the modularity makes it easy to implement new protocols and tie them into the suite. Additionally, each daemon implements a plugin system allowing new functionality to be loaded at runtime.
